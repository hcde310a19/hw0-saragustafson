# To count a number of words in a document first I would define what a word is and count every space as word. Next, I would define a count variable so that for every word, there is an addtion of one to the count. So for " " the counter would add one to the word count. The program would terminate once the document has no space characters left to count. 

# This exercise was difficult because you cannnot test the program you are trying to create. You also have to find words to describe what would be easier to write down in code. It is a little tricky to describe programs in this way an i feel unsatisfied in my result. Though it is very important for programs to be easily explained so that they aren't mis interpreted by programmers or users.

# In this class I hope to gain more of an understanding of what programming means to me and also ways I can potentially use its capabilities in the future. I'm excited to create projects I can be proud of and gain a more technical understanding of design and engineering.
